Hi!
Welcome to a first test.
This is to ensure you know how to do the questions.
This is a fairly simple task.
# Description: Calculate a+b
# Input:
Two integer a,b (0<=a,b<=10)
# Output:
Output a+b
# Sample Input
1 2
# Sample Output
3
# Hint
Q: Where are the input and the output?
A: Your program shall always read input from stdin (Standard Input) and write output to stdout (Standard Output). For example, you can use 'scanf' in C or 'cin' in C++ to read from stdin, and use 'printf' in C or 'cout' in C++ to write to stdout.
You shall not output any extra data to standard output other than that required by the problem, otherwise you will get a "Wrong Answer".
User programs are not allowed to open and read from/write to files.
In python, it is: sys.stdin.readline()
In C, C++, you have to use: cin, cout
In Java, you have to use: Scanner

# How to submit
If you are using C, C++ and Java, for version reason, please upload both a .java / .cpp / .c file, as well as a compiled executable to avoid strange things. This can help debug.
If you are using Python, upload .py files would suffice.
# How does Github classroom work for me?
Always submit main.py or compile to main Executable as that's how test.py works.
After test.py verify all pre-tests you should be fine.
If test.py has an error you will see a clear error.
Here is a demo: <br>
